<div style="text-align: left;">
Consider dated C++ comments, which are the usual C++ comments with a date
in DD/MM/YYYY format occurring anywhere in the first line of the comment; D, M, Y can be
any decimal digits. Here are some examples:
<li>(a) // 31/12/2023 ... working on New Yearâ€™s eve; there must be more to life ...! 
<li>(b) /* Modifed todai 00/00/0000
There shuld be no more erors. */

This Python program dcom rm.py is designed to remove all comments from a C++ program without the use of the regular expression.   
The program should work as follows:  

$ python dcom_rm.py inputC.cpp inputC_rm.cpp
</div>
